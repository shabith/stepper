{"name":"Stepper","tagline":" numeric step input - angular/bootstrap","body":"Angular - stepper\r\n=================\r\n\r\nA simple step numeric input written with angular and bootstrap styling. It also contains a simple date input element \r\nif you don't want to use the bootstrap's datepicker.\r\nNo JQuery needed, no extra dependency needed.\r\n\r\nBeing writen by someone that does this as a hobby, it sure needs a lot of inprovments and also testing outside webkit.\r\nI can't imagine what IE does with it and, to tell you the truth, using IE should get you ashamed not angry because \r\nof impropper rendering.\r\n\r\nThe library contains two directives:\r\n\r\nstep-number\r\nusage: \r\n\r\n    <step-number ng-model=\"yourVar\" max=\"Mval\" min = \"mVal\"></step-number>\r\n\r\nstep-date\r\nusage: \r\n\r\n    <step-date ng-model=\"yourDate\"></step-date>\r\n    \r\nIt has no support for ESC, ENTER (+/-) and (up/down) keys yet. I plan adding this feature in the near future.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
