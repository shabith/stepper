{"name":"Stepper","tagline":" numeric step input - angular/bootstrap","body":"![stepper-logo](images/stepper.png \"stepper logo\")  Angular/Bootstrap - stepper\r\n=================\r\n\r\nA simple step numeric input written in angular with bootstrap styling. It also contains a simple date input element \r\nif you don't want to use the bootstrap's datepicker.\r\n\r\nNo JQuery needed, no extra dependency needed.\r\n\r\nBeing writen by someone that does this as a hobby, it sure needs a lot of inprovments and also testing outside webkit.\r\nI can't imagine what IE does with it and, to tell you the truth, using IE should get you ashamed not angry because \r\nof impropper rendering.\r\n\r\nNo validation required because the directive inhibits any other input except digits and also limits the input to the min, max attributes.\r\n\r\nThe library contains two directives:\r\n\r\nstep-number\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nusage: \r\n\r\n    <step-number ng-model=\"yourVar\" max=\"youMaxValue\" min = \"yourMinValue\"></step-number>\r\n\r\nstep-date\r\n-----------\r\nusage: \r\n\r\n    <step-date ng-model=\"yourDate\"></step-date>\r\n\r\nTo do: there is a huge regExp that checks if a date is valid including leap years. It might be nice to include some validation capabilities. Also a configuration object to be passed to the element would be a bonus.\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks like rendered with the default bootstrap theme:\r\n\r\n![default-render](images/bootstrap-default.jpg \"default bootsrap theme appearence\")\r\n\r\nHere is a working [demo](http://www.stepper.blinduben.ro).\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
